    <h1>The .ojn file format</h1>
    <p>The .ojn file format is used in O2Jam to store the metadata for the song and
        the maps, the BPMs, images, and the placement of the notes.
        <br><br>
        O2Jam uses 2 images, one functions as a thumbnail and the other as a splash
        screen. The thumbnail is shown while you are selecting a map to play and
        the splash image is shown when you select the map. These images are in
        the .ojn file.
        <br><br>
        In O2Jam a song usually comes with 3 maps labeled by difficulty: EX
        (Easy), NX (Normal), and HX (Hard). These maps are stored in the .ojn file.
        <br><br>
        There are 3 types of notes: normal-notes, long-notes, and autoplay-notes.
        The autoplay-notes are not meant to be hit by the player, instead they
        are invisible and the purpose of them is to play audio without depending on user input.
        <br><br>
        An .ojn is mostly composed of events, and events comes inside event packages.
        An event package has a header that already tells you in which measure and in which
        channel the events are going to be deployed, as well as telling you the number of events.
    </p>

    <table>
        <caption>Event package header (size 8 bytes)</caption>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Description</th>
                <th>Type/Size</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>The measure in where the events are going to be deployed.</td>
                <td>Integer 4 bytes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>The channel the events belong to.</td>
                <td>Short integer 2 bytes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>The number of events.</td>
                <td>Short integer 2 bytes</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Since the package header already tells you the measure and the channel, an
        event is just the value. The size of the value is 4 bytes and since an event
        is just the value it means that the size of an event is 4 bytes. These 4
        bytes can be interpreted as a float or as a structure called "Note event"
        depending on the channel.
        <br><br>
        O2Jam counts measures starting from 0, and the channel range is 0-22. The
        description of the channels is as follows:
        <br><br>
        Channel 0 = Measure fraction channel
        <br>
        Channel 1 = BPM channel
        <br>
        Channel 2 = Column 1 channel
        <br>
        Channel 3 = Column 2 channel
        <br>
        Channel 4 = Column 3 channel
        <br>
        Channel 5 = Column 4 channel
        <br>
        Channel 6 = Column 5 channel
        <br>
        Channel 7 = Column 6 channel
        <br>
        Channel 8 = Column 7 channel
        <br>
        Channel 9-22 = Autoplay-note channels
        <br><br>
        If the channel is 0 or 1, an event is interpreted as a float. In channel 0
        the float indicates how much of the measure is going to be used: if the value
        is 0.75, the size of the measure is going to be 75% the normal size.
        In channel 1 the float represents a BPM value.
        <br><br>
        If the channel ranges between 2 and 22 an event is interpreted as a Note event
        structure.
    </p>

        <caption>Note event structure (size 4 bytes)</caption>

            <tr>

            <tr>

                    0 and 8 means center, and ranging between 9 and 15 means center -&gt; right.
                </td>
                <td>Half a byte, 4 bits</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Note-type: You must compare the value as an int like 0 not '0'. 0 means normal note, 2 means
                    start of a long note, and 3 means end of a long note. 4 indicates the use of an .ogg music
                    sample in Notetool (Notetool is a map editor for O2Jam maps).
                </td>
                <td>char 1 byte</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>The position of an event inside a measure is determined by the number of
        events: if you got an event package with 16 events, the position of the
        8th event is 8/16, 8/16 yields 0.5 which means that the 8th event is
        located in the middle of the measure. This is why Note events that are
        to be ignored (with reference 0) exists, their purpose is for padding.
        <br><br>
        The .ojn format has an initial header that contains the package count for
        the EX, NX, and HX maps, it also stores other important information.
        Knowing the event package count for a certain map, the size of an
        event package header (8 bytes), the number of events in a package, and that
        the size of an event is 4 bytes: you can design the loop for extracting
        the events in the event packages.
